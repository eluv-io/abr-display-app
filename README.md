You must be owner of the Content Type or have sufficient permissions on the individual mezzanine object to install the app.

#### Installing for a Content Type

* Go to **Content Types** in sidebar of Fabric Browser and click on your content type

* Click on your object
* Click the **Apps** button at top (if you don't see it, you do not have permissions to edit the object)
* Click the **Add Display App** button, then **Browse**
* Select the index.html file and click **Submit** button
* Click **Back** button to return to Content Type's "Content Info" screen
* Click on the **Display** tab to try out the new app.
